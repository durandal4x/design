The surface gravity of a planet determines the fuel costs for resources and ships to be transported out of the planet.

It could also have an impact on combat near it, if you're fighting with the gravity well to your back you are potentially less manoeuvrable, like fighting up hill.

Additional questions:
- Should gravity affect resource extraction?
- What effects will gravity have on resource production/refinement?
- What effects will gravity have on the population of a planet?
