# Log
- Started by talking about [[Newtonian physics]]
	- Teifion is struggling to implement it
		- Discussed different ways of how these could be problematic
		- Agreed they allow for very cool actions like firing asteroids at targets years in advance
		- Generally agreed something like Factorio ship travel system is interesting
	- Raghna suggests using present day technology
	- Discussed how we want fuel to be a limiting factor
	- Liked the idea of once you're travelling you're sort of stuck with that
	- For the MVP have a static cost to travel between planets at any given point
		- Later bring in transfer windows etc
	- Players would be able to tweak fuel burn to travel faster/slower with relative tradeoffs
	- Raghna going to have a go at making interface mockups and ideas
	- Teifion suggested combat be pushed back a lot as it will be so influenced by movement
		- Raghna agreed though is excited for it
- Both of us had quite different opinions on where we think things should start off in terms of tech levels but both agreed these will be worked out as we move forwards
- Raghna has been playing some [[Victoria 3]] and commented on how some of the things will be interesting for Durandal
	- He's also played some board games and willu be making notes on them for mechanics we might want to think about
