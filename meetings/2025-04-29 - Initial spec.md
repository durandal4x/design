[[Raghna]] shared an initial vision - [[Raghna initial game components]]

# Log
- Teifion suggested we were viewing it differently (in particular the near vs future timeframe)
- Teifion shared how he liked Raghna's ideas and how it can work with a semi-persistent world which resets every X (e.g. 6) months
- Raghna's doc is a brain dump and to work out the mechanics needed we'd need to refactor it into something more like a specification file
- Raghna plans to write out an example of an early game sequence of events
	- In particular taking into account there are multiple starting positions
- Raghna was concerned late game might be too safe compared to early game
	- Teifion gave examples of where that's not the carse (BAR and Afus line)
	- Raghna is concerned of zombie empires where a player leaves the game, high risk allows for easier trimming of empires and resetting things a little
- Teifion asked about how much loss we wanted to enable for players to put stakes into things
	- Raghna likes the idea of being able to lose everything
	- Raghna pointed out how important it is to not go too far either direction
- Teifion suggests keeping in mind at every stage that we want to encourage co-op
	- Raghna likes the idea of contracts allowing players to provide services to each other such as providing rockets
- Teifion asked Raghna which mechanic he thinks should be added next
	- Raghna liked the idea of resource extraction
	- Teifion suggested resources
	- Raghna wanted to know if money counted as a resource, are there alternatives?
	- Teifion said yes but that it's not as simple as just a number, money is whatever people want it to be
	- Teifion shared a [video on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZkP2b-4vo)
- Teifion asked if Raghna would like to pen ideas for resources
	- Raghna was happy for Teifion to do it
	- Raghna commented he was not a fan [[Terra Invicta]] does it, specifically the immediate transportation of resource
		- Teifion completely agreed, resources will have logistics behind them
		- Both liked the idea of the logistics being as automated as possible but allowing for players to min-max
	- Raghna said the [[Distant worlds]] game has a lot of resources but everything costs a bit of everything and they are everywhere so you quickly stop worrying about them and the value of the mechanic is lost
	- Teifion suggested he would pen a document for the resources
		- Raghna approved
