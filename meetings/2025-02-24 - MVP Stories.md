# Log

* Story elements of escape velocity.
	- Earth as NPC with factions and scenarios.
* For story, options could include
	* EVE online as player driven 100%.
	* DM style with news organization detailing recap.
* Limited information as a way to diplomatically influence neighbours.
* Soft power as an important factor. War can (should?) be crippling.
* A living universe as story.
* We agree on having an engine first and then build modules on top of that.
* Stories as a series of events. These packs of events can be put in or taken out. Modular, can be run locally and customized.
* Blogpost to get other interested parties something to show.
