# Log
- Raghna is in favour of simulating gravity
	- Teifion is in favour of making it simplified but still present
	- Both agreed it's not part of the MVP
- Discussed speed of ticks
	- Real-time and Game-time components
	- Can adjust either
- Speed of information
	- Speed of light is quite fast, Jupiter is under an hour from Earth
	- Probably don't need to worry about speed of information while in a single solar system
	- Would be cool for information systems to be strategic targets (e.g. comms relays and monitoring stations) such that destroying them can impact what an opponent knows
	- Discussed quantum entanglement, where you need to send quantum bits ahead of time and sending messages thus has a cost similar to [[Risen Empire Novella]]
	- [[Honor Harrington Novella]] style [[Hyperspace]] and [[Information travel time]]
- Raghna (might have been meant to be removed earlier but Teifion forgot), Removed colonies from MVP list
- Raghna asked if we want to track if a ship is in an engagement
	- Teifion said yes but not yet, long term we'll want to track engagements as entities and have membership of them
