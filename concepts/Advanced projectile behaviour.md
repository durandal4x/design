# Description
Projectiles typically fall into two categories:
- Direct (flat) trajectory
- Indirect trajectory

Advanced projectile behaviour means projectiles which do not broadly follow these rules. This can range from a "hunter seeker" type behaviour where the projectile will search for the target to impact all the way down to prepared waypoints a projectile will follow.

## Examples
- [[Nebulous fleet command]]  has different seeking methods and the ability to map waypoints for cruise missiles
