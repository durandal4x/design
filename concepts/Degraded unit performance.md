# Description
When a common action (as opposed to a special effect or ability) causes a reduction in the ability or performance of a unit.

## Examples
- [[Nebulous fleet command]] ships will suffer component damage and loss causing the benefits of that component (e.g. a missile pod) to be lost and the overall performance of the ship in question to be degraded as such.
