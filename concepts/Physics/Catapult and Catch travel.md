As a way of [[Fast travel]] ships can enter a Catapult structure.

This structure injects the ship with relative speed without acceleration.

The ship is directed at a specific Catch structure that absorbs the relative speed from the ship without deceleration. 

This creates established shipping lines, gives real limitations to fast travel and doesn't speed up exploration.
