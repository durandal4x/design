The first and most important choice players face, is which type of organization they chose.

They chose between playing as a [[Political]], [[Economical]] or [[Cultural]] entity.

In essence, each of these could perform any task, but their inherent structure favors certain playstyles. A government can operate an industrial steel plant, but it will do so much less efficiently.

These differences allow players to co-operate compete and co-exist in unique ways amongst each other.
