# Description


## Makes notable use of
- [[Hyperspace]]
	- Ship speed is limited by their hardware (in particular Particle shielding) as well as their mass
	- Impeller wedge shielding does not work in hyperspace completely changing the nature of combat in it
	- Hyperspace is not accessible from near a large gravitational mass
	- Hyperspace lanes exist
	- Navigation is hard and often imprecise, a highly skilled crew would have a notable accuracy advantage. At the same time, coordinating a fleet in hyperspace is very possible and would typically arrive roughly in formation.
	- Mini-jumps were possible but the precision plays a big role
- [[Wormhole]] to instantly move between very distant points
	- They have a mass limit and trying to move through the wormhole after triggering the mass limit will be ineffective
- [[Advanced projectile behaviour]] with programmable missiles
	- Starting with basic missiles
	- Moving to two stage missiles allowing a silent coasting period in the middle of the flight
	- Missile telemetry being very relevant to missile effectiveness
- [[Movement speed]] based tactics via [[Newtonian physics]]
