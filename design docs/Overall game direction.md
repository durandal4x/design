# Overview
This document is intended to provide direction and guidance on the design of the game as a whole. Like all other design docs it should be considered a working document and not set in stone.

## Overarching objectives
- 4x game
- Set in space
- Co-op and collaborative in nature (PvP and competition is still present, just not the primary focus)

### General objectives
- Aim for realism but pick game play fun over realism if the two come into conflict
