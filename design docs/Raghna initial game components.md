Government player chooses what type of government space agency it runs, with which focuses.
Can have their own rockets, or contract to private companies.
Focuses on commercial satellites, research, military, etc.
Satisfying the needs of the country can help boost funding.
Public image has strong impact on funding. Accidents, new discoveries, and so on playing an important role.
They can choose to expand its satellite launches, develop modules for the ISS, fulfil research needs from independent groups etc.

Business player can develop specific rockets, launching methods and bid for government contracts.
Depending on the specific need, not all rockets will be able to fit all needs.
Prices and margins, R&D funding, technologies used are all considerations for the business player.

Helium-3 fusion has been achieved and He-3 is in very high demand.
Moon mining operation is the primary focus of the initial stages of the game.

Government or business players can start a plan to build a moon mining operation, to sell He-3 on earth.
A long list of requirements and difficulties will make this large undertaking.
Potential sites need to be surveyed.
Blueprints and entire layout need to be designed.

A. Mining Infrastructure
B. Thermal Extraction Systems
C. Helium-3 Processing & Separation
D. Power Generation and Storage
E. Launch & Transport Systems
F. Habitat & Life Support
G. Construction & Assembly Systems
H. Control, Autonomy & Robotics
I. Communications & Navigation
J. Laboratory & Monitoring Equipment
K. Logistics & Storage
L. Safety, Redundancy & Emergency Systems
M. Earth-Based Support Infrastructure

Specific technologies need to be chosen, or left for (sub)contractors to be decided.
A wide range of options need to be considered, such as human operated, remote operated or fully automated; construction methods; scale of initial operation; room for scalability;...
Once the project has been launched, bids can be made for different components of the project.
Contracts, including prices, fines for delays, responsibilities etc are drawn up and agreed upon.
Project can be launched before all components have been fully been accounted for, at risk of running operation costs before it's completed.

Once the project is underway, businesses can seek to specialize to provide specific components or services highly efficiently.
Businesses can be structured in different ways.
Departments can be merged or separated, different corporate structures can be implemented.
Each providing benefits and drawbacks, such as expertise being concentrated, or spread out; overhead costs; flexibility;....
As such businesses can seek to specialize, offer a more expensive "all-your-needs-in-on-packet" with interoperability bonuses. Or focus on one component and become highly efficient at it such that it can outcompete on price, flexibility,...

Once the first moon mining operations are sending He-3 to earth, and profits start to roll in, a wide range of peripheral operations are ready to be undertaken.
Now the rest of the solar system is ready to be exploited.
Once enough humans are in space, cultural entities enter play as well.
